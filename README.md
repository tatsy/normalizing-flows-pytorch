> PyTorch implementations of the networks for normalizing flows.

Models

* Glow
  * Kingma and Dhariwal 2018, "Glow: Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions," [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03039v2) [[code]](https://github.com/openai/glow)
* Residual Flow
  * Behrmann et al., 2018, "Residual Flows for Invertible Generative Modeling," [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02735) [[code]](https://github.com/rtqichen/residual-flows)

* FFJORD
  * Grathwohl et al., 2018, "FFJORD: Free-form Continuous Dynamics for Scalable Reversible Generative Models," [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01367) [[code]](https://github.com/rtqichen/ffjord)

### Remark

This repository is for easier understanding of the above networks. Therefore, you should use official source cods if provided.


Setup
---

### Anaconda

By Anaconda, you can easily setup the environment using `environment.yml`.

```shell
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Pip

If you use `pip` or other tools, see the dependencies in [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml)

Run
---

This repo uses `hydra` to manage hyper parameters in training and evaluation. See [`configs`](./configs) folder to check the parameters for each network.

```shell
$ python main.py \
    network=[realnvp, glow, flow++, iresnet, ffjord]\
    train.distrib=[circles, moons, normals, swiss, s_curve, mnist, cifar10]
```

### Note

Currently, I tested the networks only for 2D density transformation. So, results for 3D densities (`swiss` and `s_curve`) and images (`mnist` and `cifar10`) could be what you expect.
